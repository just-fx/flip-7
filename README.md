# Description
This is a random mini project that is supposed to mimic the gameplay of the card game [Flip 7](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420087/flip-7). 
This was designed on a whim one random morning because I just randomly had the urge to code this ☕, so this is very much still a WIP 🛠️ Right now, it only has the number cards 
and is only for one round. Nevertheless, it can handle any # of players. Happy gambling! 🤑

# Roadmap:
Eventually, would want to add the ff for whenever I get random motivation and inspiration again 😂:
- power cards (e.g., freeze and second chance)
- more rounds
- maybe a UI
